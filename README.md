This is a food ordering application.

Design Patterns:
    Creation:
1) Singleton - for creation OrderHistory
2) Builder - for construct complex objects step by step
    Structural:
3) Bridge - lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction
            and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
4) Facade - provides a simplified interface
    Behavioral:
5) Strategy - lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable
6) Observer - lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing
